*Crunch*  Alarmingly, a section of metal on a nearby wall suddenly begins fold in on itself as it fails under the pressure difference between the station and the void of space.  Bolts pop from the armored plating, ricocheting across the room at speeds faster than bullets.  In a few moments, a hull breach will occur if you don't do anything!
