EVENT - Hull Breach From Neglectful Maintainance

*Crunch*  Alarmingly, a section of metal on a nearby wall begins fold in on itself as it fails under the pressure difference between the station and the void of space.  It looks like poor maintainance is causing the wall to collapse! Bolts pop from the armored plating, ricocheting across the room at speeds faster than bullets.  In a few moments, a hull breach will occur if you don't do anything!

EVENT - Playful AI

An odd noise reaches your ears: a giggle...  Something flits by at the edge of your vision, but when you turn to look, it is no longer there.  It happens again, and you spin around to see nothing once more.

A girl's voice speaks: "You're not supposed to be here, you know."  Behind you, on a nondescript screen hanging halfway from the wall, a small person, a girl, consctructed of ASCII lettering wags a finger at you.

- [EMP] Disable the monitor, you don't want to deal with whatever this is.
- [Gun] Shoot the monitor.

PERSISTENT EVENT - Injured Survivor

A weak moan reaches your ears.  Somebody is in this room!  A quick glance around reveals a man lying on the floor, leg jutting out at an awkward angle.  His eyes squint at you as you approach, and widen when he realizes that somebody else is alive.

"Help me..." he rasps, grasping at his leg.

- [Brandy] Pour some brandy and offer it to him.
